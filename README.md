# Hamming_Distance
This is a C code to generate G matrix [Linear Block Codes(LBC)] from given codewords.

ver 3 is can take input as "char". So Hamming distance can be calculated among strings of integers like binary, quaternary and strings of characters.
The output also shows two string with minimum distance.
ISSUE: String must be of same length to have desired result.
